# Lenovo AI Engineering Case Study

## Integrated AI Accessibility Platform for the Scott-Morgan Foundation

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Build:** 1

---

## Executive Summary

This initiative presents Lenovo with a significant opportunity to demonstrate its leadership in AI engineering and developing a **next-generation Integrated Accessibility Platform**. Building on successful demonstrations at Lenovo Tech World, this platform aims to consolidate various assistive technologies‚Äîsuch as **eye tracking**, **smart robotic wheelchairs**, **voice cloning**, **avatars**, and **assistants**‚Äîinto a unified, open-source system.

By employing **Vibe Programming**, a generative AI-driven software development approach, this project seeks to expedite development, evaluate AI's impact, and generate **publishable research and case studies** that compare AI-accelerated methodologies with traditional development approaches.
