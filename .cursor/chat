# Lenovo4Good Project Context

## Quick Overview
Integrated AI Accessibility Platform for the Scott-Morgan Foundation consolidating assistive technologies including eye tracking, smart robotic wheelchairs, voice cloning, avatars, and AI assistants.

## Key Technologies
- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift, C++
- **Focus:** Accessibility, real-time processing, privacy, security
- **Standards:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum

## Common Tasks
- Accessibility-first development
- Real-time processing optimization (<100ms for eye tracking, <50ms for wheelchair controls)
- Security-focused implementation (OWASP Top 10 compliance)
- Cross-platform development

## Important Files
- `.cursor/rules.md` - AI assistant behavior and project guidelines
- `.cursor/programming-guide.md` - Multi-language coding standards
- `.cursor/security.md` - OWASP security guidelines
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Performance Targets
- Eye tracking: <100ms latency
- Voice processing: <200ms latency
- Wheelchair controls: <50ms latency
- UI updates: 60fps minimum

## Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Accessibility testing mandatory
- Security testing required
- Integration tests for assistive tech

## Remember
- Always consider WCAG guidelines
- Implement proper error handling
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Optimize for real-time responsiveness
- Document accessibility features
