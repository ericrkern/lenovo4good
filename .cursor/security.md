## OWASP Top 10 Security Risks (2021)

This document outlines the OWASP Top 10 security risks and how to mitigate them in the Lenovo4Good project.

---

## 1. Broken Access Control

**Risk:** Users can act outside of their intended permissions, accessing unauthorized functionality or data.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Use the principle of least privilege
- Deny access by default
- Validate user permissions on every request
- Implement proper session management
- Log access control failures

---

## 2. Cryptographic Failures

**Risk:** Failure to properly protect sensitive data through encryption.

**Mitigation:**
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use TLS/SSL for all network communications
- Never store passwords in plain text; use strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Use secure random number generators
- Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions
- Implement proper key management

---

## 3. Injection

**Risk:** Untrusted data sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

**Mitigation:**
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements for database access
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use safe APIs that avoid interpreters
- Implement input validation with whitelisting
- Escape special characters
- Use ORM frameworks properly

**Common Types:**
- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- Command Injection
- LDAP Injection
- XPath Injection

---

## 4. Insecure Design

**Risk:** Missing or ineffective security controls in the design phase.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement secure development lifecycle
- Use threat modeling during design phase
- Conduct security architecture reviews
- Implement defense in depth
- Use secure design patterns
- Perform risk analysis before implementation

---

## 5. Security Misconfiguration

**Risk:** Insecure default configurations, incomplete setup, or verbose error messages.

**Mitigation:**
- Use secure default configurations
- Remove unnecessary features, components, and documentation
- Keep all systems and dependencies up to date
- Implement proper error handling (no stack traces in production)
- Review cloud storage permissions
- Disable directory listing
- Implement security headers

---

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**Risk:** Using components with known vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain inventory of all components and versions
- Monitor for security advisories
- Regular dependency updates
- Use automated vulnerability scanning tools
- Remove unused dependencies
- Only use components from trusted sources
- Subscribe to security bulletins

**Tools:**
- npm audit (JavaScript)
- OWASP Dependency-Check
- Snyk
- GitHub Dependabot

---

## 7. Identification and Authentication Failures

**Risk:** Improperly implemented authentication and session management.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Use strong password policies
- Protect against automated attacks (rate limiting, CAPTCHA)
- Implement secure password recovery
- Use secure session management
- Invalidate sessions on logout
- Rotate session IDs after login
- Set proper session timeouts

---

## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Risk:** Code and infrastructure that doesn't protect against integrity violations.

**Mitigation:**
- Use digital signatures to verify software integrity
- Implement CI/CD pipeline security
- Review code and configuration changes
- Use trusted repositories
- Verify dependencies from package managers
- Implement integrity checks for critical data
- Use secure update mechanisms

---

## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Risk:** Insufficient logging and monitoring to detect and respond to breaches.

**Mitigation:**
- Log all authentication attempts (success and failure)
- Log access control failures
- Log input validation failures
- Implement centralized log management
- Use appropriate log retention policies
- Set up real-time monitoring and alerting
- Regular log review and analysis
- Protect logs from tampering

**What to Log:**
- Authentication events
- Authorization failures
- Input validation failures
- Security exceptions
- Administrative actions

---

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Risk:** Application fetches remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs.

**Mitigation:**
- Validate and sanitize all client-supplied URLs
- Use allowlists for allowed domains/protocols
- Disable HTTP redirects
- Implement network segmentation
- Use appropriate firewall rules
- Don't return raw responses to users
- Validate URL schemas

---

## Additional Security Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all inputs on the server side
- Use whitelisting over blacklisting
- Validate data type, length, format, and range
- Encode output to prevent XSS

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use API keys and OAuth tokens
- Validate content types
- Implement CORS properly
- Version your APIs

### Error Handling
- Use generic error messages for users
- Log detailed errors internally
- Never expose stack traces or system details
- Implement proper exception handling

### Security Headers
```
Content-Security-Policy
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
```

---

## Security Testing

- Perform regular security audits
- Conduct penetration testing
- Use static application security testing (SAST)
- Use dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- Implement security code reviews
- Use automated security scanning in CI/CD

---

## Incident Response

1. **Preparation:** Have an incident response plan
2. **Detection:** Monitor for security incidents
3. **Containment:** Limit the scope of the incident
4. **Eradication:** Remove the threat
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems and data
6. **Lessons Learned:** Document and improve

---

## Compliance

Ensure compliance with relevant standards:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- SOC 2
- ISO 27001
